        <p>
          Multivariable calculus involves functions that have multiple inputs or output a list of multiple numbers. Because of this, the concept of vectors appears a lot in multivariable calculus.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two ways of thinking about what a vector is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A vector is a list of numbers (but can sometimes contain other things).</li>
          <li>A vector is a quantity with magnitude and direction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I’m going to focus on the second way of thinking about vectors: that a vector is a quantity with magnitude and direction. What exactly does that mean? Usually, we think of vectors graphically as arrows on the coordinate plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will be discussing 2D vectors here (vectors with 2 values that can be drawn in 2 dimensions), but a lot of the concepts are similar for 3D vectors and vectors with even more dimensions.
        </p>
        <img class="graph" src="images/2d_vector.png">
        <p class="ntm sn">
          The arrow from <span class="red">point A</span> to <span class="blue">point B</span> is a vector since it has a magnitude (i.e. length) and a direction. It is a 2D vector since it is on a 2-dimensional coordinate plane. (Note: vectors can begin anywhere on the coordinate plane. In this diagram, <span class="red">point A</span> is at the origin, but it doesn’t have to be. What determines the vector is the displacement between the two points.)
        </p>
        <p>
          2D vectors have an \(x\)-component and a \(y\)-component. The \(x\)-component is the horizontal displacement of the vector and the \(y\)-component is the vertical displacement. In the diagram above, the vector has an \(x\)-component of 3 and a \(y\)-component of 4. The \(x\)-component and \(y\)-component can also be negative (represented by an arrow pointing to the left or down respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
          Vectors are usually notated with a letter in bold, such as \(\mathbf{v}\). There are multiple ways to notate the components of a vector. One way is to write them like coordinates, so for example the vector in the above diagram is \(\mathbf{v} = (3, 4)\). The first value is the \(x\)-component and the second value is the \(y\)-component of the vector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way is to write the vector in terms of the unit vectors \(\mathbf{i} = (1, 0)\) and \(\mathbf{j} = (0, 1)\). In this notation, our vector can be written as \(\mathbf{v} = (3, 4) = (3, 0) + (0, 4) = 3\mathbf{i} + 4\mathbf{j}\). The coefficient of \(\mathbf{i}\) is the \(x\)-component and the coefficient of \(\mathbf{j}\) is the \(y\)-component of the vector.
        </p>

          To find the magnitude (i.e. length) of a vector (denoted by \(||\mathbf{v}||\)), we can use the Pythagorean Theorem. Notice how in the diagram above, the \(x\)- and \(y\)-components form a right triangle with the vector. In this case, the magnitude of the vector \(\mathbf{v} = (3, 4)\) is \(||\mathbf{v}|| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5\).
        </p>
        <p class="large-text bold">Vector operations</p>
        <p>
          We can multiply a vector by a scalar (i.e. a single number). To do that, we just multiply each component of the vector by the scalar. If \(\mathbf{v} = (1, 2)\), then \(4\mathbf{v} = (4\cdot 1, 4\cdot 2) = (4, 8)\). This scalar can also be -1, i.e. we can find the negative of a vector by multiplying all components by -1. In our example, \(-\mathbf{v} = (-1, -2)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          We can add two vectors by adding their components together. For example, if \(\mathbf{v} = (1, 2)\) and \(\mathbf{w} = (3, 4)\), then \(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} = (1 + 3, 2 + 4) = (4, 6)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          To add two vectors visually, first place the tail of the second vector at the head of the first vector. Then the sum of the vectors will be the vector that goes from the tail of the first vector to the head of the second vector.
        </p>
        <img class="graph" src="images/vector_addition.png">
        <p>
          Similarly, we can subtract two vectors by subtracting their components. If \(\mathbf{v} = (1, 2)\) and \(\mathbf{w} = (3, 4)\), then \(\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{v} = (3 - 1, 4 - 2) = (2, 2)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two ways to visualize this: the first is to add the vectors \(\mathbf{w}\) and \(-\mathbf{v}\) to get \(\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{v}\).
        </p>
        <img class="graph" src="images/vector_subtraction_2.png">
        <p>
          The second way is to draw the vectors for \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{w}\). The vector that goes from the head of \(\mathbf{v}\) to the head of \(\mathbf{w}\) is \(\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{v}\).

        <p class="ntm sn">
          This diagram shows that \(\mathbf{v} + (\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{w}\).

          In previous calculus classes, you dealt with functions involving a single input and a single output. These are known as single-variable functions, and the way we typically visualize them is with 2-dimensional graphs: one dimension for the input variable and one dimension for the output variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in multivariable calculus, we often deal with functions with more than one input (these are known as multivariable functions). To visualize these functions, we need more than 2 dimensions!
        </p>
        <p>
          Often, we use 3-dimensional graphs to visualize functions with two inputs. But how do 3D graphs work? That’s what I’m going to discuss now!
        </p>
        <p>
          In two-dimensional graphs, we have two axes: the \(x\)-axis and the \(y\)-axis. When we introduce a third dimension, we need to add a new axis: the \(z\)-axis, that is perpendicular to the other two axes.
        </p>
        <img class="graph" src="images/3d_axes.png">
        <p>
          In two dimensions, the point \((x, y)\) would be plotted \(x\) units along the \(x\)-axis and \(y\) units along the \(y\)-axis. In three dimensions, we do something similar: the point \((x, y, z)\) would be plotted \(x\) units along the \(x\)-axis, \(y\) units along the \(y\)-axis, and \(z\) units along the \(z\)-axis.
        </p>

          This is the point \((\class{blue}{1}, \class{green}{2}, \class{purple}{3})\) plotted in 3D space. It is plotted <span class="blue">1 unit along the \(x\)-axis</span>, <span class="green">2 units along the \(y\)-axis</span>, and <span class="purple">3 units along the \(z\)-axis</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can also create vectors in 3D space. For example, this is the vector \((1, 2, 3)\):

          There are some operations we can perform between two vectors. One of the most common operations is the <strong>dot product</strong>. The dot product of two vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is denoted by \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}\).
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two ways of thinking of the dot product.
        </p>
        <p class="bold large-text">
          The dot product as a sum of products
        </p>
        <p class="nbm">
          To find the dot product of two vectors, you multiply corresponding components together, then sum up all of the products. Here’s an example:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \mathbf{a} = (\class{red}{1}, \class{blue}{2}, \class{purple}{3}) \]
          \[ \mathbf{b} = (\class{red}{4}, \class{blue}{5}, \class{purple}{6}) \]
          \[ \begin{flalign}
          \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} &= (\class{red}{1 \cdot 4}) + (\class{blue}{2\cdot 5}) + (\class{purple}{3\cdot 6})\\
          &= 4 + 10 + 18\\
          &= 32
          \end{flalign}\]
        </div>
        <p class="ntm">
          Notice that the result of a dot product is a scalar (a single number), not a vector.
        </p>
        <p class="bold large-text">
          The geometric meaning of the dot product
        </p>
        <p class="nbm">
          The dot product can also be found with this formula:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = ||\mathbf{a}||\:||\mathbf{b}|| \cos(\theta)\]
        </div>
        <p class="ntm sn">
          In this formula, \(\theta\) is the angle between the two vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that \(\cos(\theta)\) is close to 1 if \(\theta\) is close to 0, and \(\cos(\theta)\) is close to 0 if \(\theta\) is close to 90 degrees. So in general, if two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction, their dot product will be larger. If two vectors are pointing in exactly the same direction, then the dot product is the product of the vectors’ magnitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If \(\theta\) is exactly 90 degrees (or \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians), then \(\cos(\theta) = 0\). This means that the dot product between two perpendicular vectors is zero. Two vectors are called <strong>orthogonal</strong> if this is the case (i.e. if \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0\), then \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) are orthogonal vectors).
        </p>
        <p>
          The dot product can also be negative if \(\cos(\theta)\) is negative. This happens when \(\theta\) is in between 90 and 180 degrees (\(\frac{\pi}{2}\) and \(\pi\) radians).

          The <strong>cross product</strong> is another operation we can perform between two vectors. The cross product of \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is denoted by \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\).
        </p>
        <p>
          While the dot product works with vectors with any number of dimensions (as long as the two vectors have the same number of dimensions), the cross product only works with two 3D vectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the dot product of two vectors is a scalar, the cross product of two vectors is another vector. Specifically, the cross product of two vectors is a third vector that is perpendicular to the other two vectors.
        </p>

          There are once again two formulas for the cross product.

            That just looks like a huge mess at first! Let’s break it down.

            \end{bmatrix} \] 
          </div>
          <p class="ntm">
            Notice how the exponent on the -1 term is \(\class{red}{1} + \class{blue}{1}\), while the coefficient in front of it is \(a_{\class{red}{1}\class{blue}{1}}\), corresponding to the element on the <span class="red">1</span>st row and <span class="blue">1</span>st column of the matrix.
          </p>
          <p>
            What about the determinant part? Notice how we’re finding the determinant of a smaller \(2 \times 2\) matrix. This matrix is just the \(3 \times 3\) matrix \(A\) but without the elements in the <span class="red">1</span>st row and the <span class="blue">1</span>st column.
          </p>
          <p class="nbm">
            The next term is:
          </p>
          <div class="mj">
            \[ a_{\class{red}{1}\class{blue}{2}}(-1)^{\class{red}{1}+\class{blue}{2}}\det\begin{bmatrix}

            a_{31} & a_{33} 
            \end{bmatrix} \] 
          </div>
          <p class="ntm">
            Once again, the exponent on the -1 term (\(\class{red}{1} + \class{blue}{2}\)) is the sum of the row and column number of the coefficient \(a_{\class{red}{1}\class{blue}{2}}\). We are multiplying these terms by the determinant of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix which is matrix \(A\) but without the <span class="red">1</span>st row and <span class="blue">2</span>nd column.
          </p>
          <p class="nbm">
            Finally, we see this pattern continue with the last term:
          </p>
          <div class="mj">
            \[ a_{\class{red}{1}\class{blue}{3}}(-1)^{\class{red}{1}+\class{blue}{3}}\det\begin{bmatrix}

            a_{31} & a_{32} 
            \end{bmatrix} \] 
          </div>
          <p class="ntm">
            The exponent on the -1 is the sum of the row and column number, and we are once again multiplying by a modified version of matrix \(A\) without the <span class="red">1</span>st row and <span class="blue">3</span>rd column.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this isn’t the only way we can calculate the determinant of \(A\). In the previous example, we used what’s known as the <strong>Laplace expansion</strong> along the first row of the matrix (since the coefficients \(a_{11}\), \(a_{12}\), \(a_{13}\) come from the first row of matrix \(A\)).
          </p>
          <p class="nbm">
            The Laplace expansion works for any row or any column of the matrix! For example, here’s the expansion along the 2nd column:
          </p>
          <div class="mj">
            \[ \det(A) = a_{12}(-1)^{1+2}\det\begin{bmatrix}

        <p>
          How do we graph a line in 3D space? Before we answer this, let’s first think about how we could graph a line in 2D.
        </p>
        <p class="nbm">
          In two dimensions, we can graph a line by choosing a point on that line, then specifying the slope of the line. This is the point-slope form of a line: the line that passes through the point \((x_0, y_0)\) with slope \(m\) is:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ y - y_0 = m(x-x_0) \]
        </div>
        <p class="ntm">
          In three dimensions, however, we can’t just describe the slope of a line with one number. Instead, we need to use a 3D vector to describe the direction that the line goes in.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what we could do instead is take two points that are on the line, then draw a vector between those two. Let’s see how this would work in 2D first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s say we want to find the equation of the line that passes through point \(A = (1, 2)\) and point \(B = (2, 5)\). We can get a vector parallel to this line by subtracting one point from the other. In this case, that vector would be \(\mathbf{v} = (2-1, 5-2) = (1, 3)\).
        </p>
        <img class="graph" src="images/2d_vector_line.png">
        <p>
          Now let’s imagine a point moving with this velocity vector. As time passes, the point will trace out our line.
        </p>
        <canvas id="2dVectorLineCanvas" class="canvas-graph"></canvas>
        <p>
          How can we describe the movement of this point with a function? We can use a vector-valued function - a function that outputs a vector.
        </p>
        <p class="nbm">
          Imagine a point at point \(A\) and moving towards point \(B\). Its velocity vector would be equal to the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) we found before. Its position at time \(t\) would be:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ f(t) = \mathbf{a} + t\mathbf{v}\]
        </div>
        <p class="ntm sn">
          \(\mathbf{a}\) is the position vector corresponding to point \(A\) (in this case, \((1, 2)\)).
        </p>
        <p>
          This is known as the <strong>vector form</strong> for the equation of a line. As \(t\) ranges across all real numbers (negative and positive), the point corresponding to \(f(t)\) will draw out the line.
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>
            <canvas id="2dVectorLineInteractiveCanvas" class="canvas-graph"></canvas>
          </p>
          <input id="2dVectorLineInteractiveSlider" class="slider" type="range" max="1" step="any" value="0" oninput="updateSliders()">
          <p>
            \(t =\) <span id="2dVectorLineInteractiveVal1" class="output-value"></span>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          We can generalize this concept to three dimensions. Let me demonstrate this with an example:
        </p>
        <p class="problem">
          <strong>Problem</strong>: What is the equation of the line that passes through the points \(A = (-2, 3, 2)\) and \(B = (3, 0, 1)\)?
        </p>
        <p class="nbm">
          First, we need to find a vector that is parallel to the line. The easiest way to do this is to find the vector that goes from point \(A\) to point \(B\) (since this vector is on the line, it will also be parallel to the line). To find this vector, we subtract the coordinates of point \(A\) from point \(B\).
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \begin{flalign}
          \mathbf{v} &= (3 - (-2), 0 - 3, 1 - 2)\\
          &= (5, -3, -1)
          \end{flalign}\]
        </div>
        <img class="graph" src="images/line_vector.png">
        <p class="ntm sn">
          The vector \(\class{green}{\mathbf{v} = (5, -3, -1)}\) starts at <span class="red">point \(A\)</span> and ends at <span class="blue">point \(B\)</span>, and it is parallel to the line since it’s on the line.
        </p>
        <p class="nbm">
          The vector form for the equation of a line in 3D space is:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \begin{flalign}
          \mathbf{r} &= \mathbf{r_0} + t\mathbf{v}\\
          &= (x_0, y_0, z_0) + t(a, b, c)\\
          &= (x_0 + ta, y_0 + tb, z_0 + tc)
          \end{flalign} \]
        </div>
        <p class="ntm sn">
          \((x_0, y_0, z_0)\) is a point on the line (with \(\mathbf{r_0}\) being the corresponding position vector), and \(\mathbf{v} = (a, b, c)\) is a vector that is parallel to the line. Just like with the 2D equation, as \(t\) ranges across all real numbers, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) traces out the line.
        </p>
        <p class="nbm">
          Back to our example now. \(\mathbf{r_0}\) can be the position vector corresponding to either of our points. So for our example, the vector form based on point \(A\) is:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \begin{flalign}
          \mathbf{r} &= (-2, 3, 2) + t(5, -3, -1)\\
          &= (-2 + 5t, 3 - 3t, 2 - t)
          \end{flalign}\]
        </div>
        <p class="nm">
          And the vector form based on point \(B\) is:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \begin{flalign}
          \mathbf{r} &= (3, 0, 1) + t(5, -3, -1)\\
          &= (3 + 5t, -3t, 1 - t)
          \end{flalign}\]
        </div>
        <p class="nm">
          This is not the only way we can describe a line in 3D. We can convert this vector form into a set of parametric equations:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ x = x_0 + ta \]
          \[ y = y_0 + tb \]
          \[ z = x_0 + tc \]
        </div>
        <p class="nm">
          This is the <strong>parametric form</strong> for the equation of a line. For our problem, the parametric form based on point \(A\) is: 
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ x = -2 + 5t \]
          \[ y = 3 - 3t \]
          \[ z = 2 - t \]
        </div>
        <p class="nm">
          Based on point \(B\), the parametric equations are:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ x = 3 + 5t \]
          \[ y = - 3t \]
          \[ z = 1 - t \]
        </div>
        <p class="nm">
          Finally, if we solve for \(t\) in each of the equations in the parametric form, we get these equations:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ t = \frac{x - x_0}{a} \]
          \[ t = \frac{y - y_0}{b} \]
          \[ t = \frac{z - z_0}{c} \]
        </div>
        <p class="nm">
          The right-hand sides of all three of these equations are equal to \(t\), so they are equal to each other. Therefore:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \frac{x - x_0}{a} = \frac{y - y_0}{b} = \frac{z - z_0}{c} \]
        </div>
        <p class="nm">
          This is the <strong>symmetric equation</strong> of a line. In this case, the symmetric equations that pass through \((-2, 3, 2)\) and \((3, 0, 1)\) are:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \frac{x + 2}{5} = \frac{y - 3}{-3} = \frac{z - 2}{-1} \]
        </div>
        <p class="nm sn">
          This equation is using point \(A\) for the coordinates \((x_0, y_0, z_0)\).
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \frac{x - 3}{5} = \frac{y}{-3} = \frac{z - 1}{-1} \]
        </div>
        <p class="nm sn">

        <p>
          We can also find the equations of planes in 3D space.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way to uniquely identify a plane in 3D is to specify three points on that plane (as long as they’re not on the same line). However, to actually find the equation of a plane, there is another, more helpful way to define a plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          All we need is one point on the plane and a normal vector to that plane (a vector perpendicular to the plane).
        </p>
        <img class="graph" src="images/plane_normal_vector.png">
        <p class="ntm sn">
          We can define a plane using <span class="green">a point on the plane</span> and a <span class="blue">normal vector</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s call this point \(P_0\), the vector corresponding to this point \(\mathbf{r_0}\), and the normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is this useful? Because if we choose a second point on the plane, then draw a vector from the first point to the second, that vector will lie completely within the plane. So this vector will be orthogonal to the normal vector, which means that the dot product of the two vectors will be zero.
        </p>
        <img class="graph" src="images/plane_normal_vector_2.png">
        <p class="ntm sn">
          The <span class="blue">normal vector</span> and the <span class="red">vector between the two points</span> are orthogonal, so their dot product is zero.
        </p>
        <p class="nbm">
          So we can define this plane as the set of all possible points \(P\) such that the vector between \(P\) and \(P_0\) is orthogonal to the normal vector (i.e. the dot product is zero). If we define the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) to be the vector corresponding to \(P\), this means:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0}) = 0 \]
          \[ \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r_0} = 0 \]
          \[ \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r_0} \]
        </div>
        <p class="nm">
          This is the <strong>vector equation</strong> of a plane. If we write out the components of the vectors with \(\mathbf{n} = (a, b, c)\), \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), and \(\mathbf{r_0} = (x_0, y_0, z_0)\), we get:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ (a, b, c) \cdot (x, y, z) = (a, b, c) \cdot (x_0, y_0, z_0) \]
          \[ ax + by + cz = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 \]
          \[ a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0 \]
        </div>
        <p class="ntm">
          This is the <strong>scalar equation</strong> of a plane.
        </p>
        <p class="problem">
          <strong>Problem</strong>: What is the equation of the plane that passes through the points \(A = (4, -2, 3)\), \(B = (0, 1, 3)\), and \(C = (-1, -5, 1)\)?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we need to find a normal vector for this plane. How could we do this?
        </p>
        <p>
          If we had two vectors that were on the plane, then found the cross product of those two vectors, that would give us a vector that is perpendicular to both of those vectors (and the plane itself), which would be a normal vector!
        </p>
        <p class="nbm">
          So let’s find two vectors that are on the plane. We can do that by finding vectors between two of our points. Here’s the vector that goes from point \(A\) to point \(B\):
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \mathbf{AB} = (0 - 4, 1 - (-2), 3 - 3) = (-4, 3, 0) \]
        </div>
        <p class="nm">
          And here’s the vector that goes from point \(A\) to point \(C\):
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \mathbf{AC} = (-1 - 4, -5 - (-2), 1 - 3) = (-5, -3, -2) \]
        </div>
        <p class="ntm">
          These are not the only two vectors we can use; there are many more possible pairs of points we can use to define our vectors.
        </p>
        <p class="nbm">
          Now let’s find the cross product of these vectors:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \begin{flalign}
          \mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{AC} &= \det\left(\begin{bmatrix}
          \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k}\\
          -4 & 3 & 0\\
          -5 & -3 & -2\\
          \end{bmatrix}\right)\\
          &= -6\mathbf{i} - 8\mathbf{j} + 27\mathbf{k}\\
          &= (-6, -8, 27)
          \end{flalign}\]
        </div>
        <p class="nm">
          Remember that in the scalar equation of the plane \((a,b,c)\) is the normal vector and \((x_0, y_0, z_0)\) is any point on the plane (we’ll use point \(A\) for this example, but points \(B\) and \(C\) would also work). So the equation is:
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0 \]

          Formal definition of Green’s Theorem
        </p>
        <p class="nbm">
          Green’s Theorem states that the line integral of the vector field \(F\) over the boundary of your region \(D\) is equivalent to the double integral of the curl of the vector field \(F\) over the region \(D\). Green’s Theorem is the 2D incarnation of the Generalized Stokes Theorem.

          Intuitive explanation of Green’s Theorem
        </p>
        <p>
          Essentially what Green’s theorem is doing is displaying that the combination of local data is equivalent to the global phenomenon. The curl of the vector field \(F\) is local meaning it is dependent on the location of the point in \(F\). Essentially what the double integral is doing is just combining the curl over the region \(D\) and saying that it is equal to the line integral of the vector field over the boundary curve of the region.

          Formal definition of Stokes’ Theorem
        </p>
        <p class="nbm">
          Stokes’ Theorem is another incarnation of generalized stokes theorem. Stokes’ Theorem exists in 3D space. Stokes’ Theorem relates a line integral to a surface integral stating that the line integral of the vector field \(F\) dotted with the parameterized function of the closed boundary curve \(C\) over said curve is equivalent to the surface integral (a double integral over a 3D surface) of the curl of \(F\) over the surface \(S\). One important thing to know is that \(S\) can be any surface with the boundary curve \(C\).
        </p>
        <div class="mj">
          \[ \iint_\Sigma (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})\cdot \dd{\mathbf{\Sigma}} = \oint_{\partial \Sigma}\mathbf{F} \cdot \dd{\mathbf{\Gamma}} \]

        </p>
        <p>
          Visualize a surface \(S\) in some vector field \(F\). Each point on \(S\) has some curl associated with it. Now think about any point \(P\) within the surface but not on the boundary. This point \(P\) has its own curl and is surrounded by points which have similar curl. Now these curls end up cancelling out everywhere except the boundary curve of the surface. Because of this the surface integral of the curl of \(F\) over \(S\) is equivalent to the line integral of \(F\) over the boundary curve.

        <p class="nbm">
          Generalized Stokes’ Theorem is generalized for \(n\) dimensions. The generalized form of this theorem states that the integral of some differential form over the boundary of your manifold is equivalent to the integral of the differential forms exterior derivative over the entirety of the manifold.

        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine an \(n\)-dimensional infinitesimal parallelotope composed of \(n\) vectors. Now this parallelotope has some average flux. Now imagine you compose your manifold of an infinite amount of these parallelepipeds composing your manifold. Essentially the combination of these average fluxes (via integration) of all the parallelepipeds within the manifold cancel out leaving us with the overall flux on the boundary of the manifold.
